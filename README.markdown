**Developer's Note:** _This was a project for one of my classes back
in college, so, it isn't done and I probably won't work on it again;
but I wanted to have it backed up. You may notice there isn't a
license. I don't have one. Feel free to play around with this if you
wish and use it in any manner you see fit (commercial or non-commercial)
and I won't stop you. However, if you are using it for something cool,
shoot me a message as I'd love to know :-)_

This readme includes all of the commands available in ACUMud as well
some basic information about the program.

Right now, the program is in what I call super-duper-alpha phase, meaning,
I have nowhere near completed it, however it is running and you can execute
certain commands. Eventually, it will be a full fledged MUD. The current
commands that have been implemented are all in the form of one character
are are as follows:

 * Quit             - Q
 * Move North       - N
 * Move South       - S
 * Move East        - E
 * Move West        - W
 * Move Northwest   - H
 * Move Northeast   - J
 * Move Southwest   - L
 * Move Southeast   - K
 * Move Up          - U
 * Move Down        - D
 * Look Around      - O
 * Print Exits      - X
 * Create Character - C

So far, these are the only commands that are working properly. One or two
others have been implemented and work, but not quite how you would expect.

Soon to be added are:

 # Full Word Commands
 # Better Character Creation
 # File input/output for saving MUD state
 # Telnet access to the MUD

There are many more things to be implemented, but these will be the focus
for the coming period of time. Expect these to be working apporixmately
one month from now (around mid May 2004).
